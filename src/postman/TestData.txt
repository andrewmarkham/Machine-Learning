While Antarctica does have a lot of water in the form of ice its cold temperatures keeps the ice from turning into liquid water even in the summer. The cold temperatures also freeze the water vapor out of the air. The end result is that Antarctica is not only a desert it is the driest continent in the world
The Sahara is a desert spanning across North Africa. With an area of 9200000 square kilometres (3600000 sq mi) it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.
The largest country in the world is Russia with a total area of 17098242 Km² (6601665 mi²) and a land area of 16376870 Km² (6323142 mi²) equivalent to 11% of the total worlds landmass of 148940000 Km² (57510000 square miles). See also: Most Populous Countries.

The Great Basin Desert is a vast arid region in the western United States covering 190000 square miles (492000 square kilometers) of Nevada Utah California Oregon Idaho and Wyoming. Its high elevation (9000 feet [2750 meters] or more above sea level) rugged terrain and scarce water resources make it one of the most desolate places in the country with much of the area receiving less than 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) of rainfall per year. The Great Basin Desert is characterized by large groves of sagebrush salt flats and dry lake beds and is home to various unique plant and animal species adapted to the desert environment. The 10th-largest desert in the world is also an important area for anthropology and natural history with various remnants of Native American habitation for thousands of years and some of the oldest plant life on the planet. For example the famous bristlecone pine known as the Prometheus Tree was between 4700 and 5000 years old when it was cut in 1965.
The Syrian Desert also known as the Badiyat ash-Sham is a 190000 square mile (492000 square kilometers) arid region in the Middle East covering parts of Syria Jordan and Iraq. It is a harsh and inhospitable environment characterized by large swaths of barren sand and gravel plains rocky mountains and occasional dry riverbeds called wadis. Like many other environments on this list the Syrian Desert provides a harsh climate for only the hardiest of nomadic traveling societies. The famed Bedouin tribes took root in this area between the first and fourth centuries C.E and many tribes still maintain their traditional lifestyle. However these groups and their homeland are under threat from several environmental challenges including oil drilling overgrazing and increasing temperatures from climate change.
This Australian desert covers an area of 250000 square miles (647497 square kilometers) in a desolate landscape in the most remotely populated continent in the world. It is a vast region comprised of mainly flat grasslands salt lakes small mountains dry valleys and rocky plateaus. Like the Sahara Desert with its rich history of nomadic peoples the Great Victoria Desert is a vital cultural and spiritual homeland for Indigenous Aboriginal civilizations that have lived there for thousands of years.
The Patagonian Desert in South America is the sixth-largest desert in the world and covers an area of 260000 square miles (673000 square kilometers) across Argentina and Chile. Backdropped by the imposing Andes Mountains and the Patagonian Steppe this semi-arid desert teams with diverse plants and animals including the Southern Beech Tree and the Patagonian Cypress. The Tehuelche people have called this place home for thousands of years. They are descended from ancient artists responsible for the paleolithic cave paintings at the UNESCO heritage site known as Cueva de las Manos. To explore these caves is to travel back in time to when the first humans left their mark on their world.
The massive Gobi Desert is the fifth-largest desert in the world at 500000 square miles (1.3 million square kilometers). This vast rain shadow desert is sandwiched between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the frigid steppes of Siberia; its an extremely cold desert with little vegetation or precipitation apart from ice and snowstorms. Temperatures dont get as cold here as they do in the arctic tundra but wind chill from Siberia can drop temperatures to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 degrees Celsius). The Gobi Desert also one of the most historically important deserts on our list. Genghis Khan established his Mongol Empire here and several Silk Road trading routes have passed through here since 130 B.C.E. connecting China with Central Asia and the Mediterranean region. As a result the Gobi Desert played a crucial role in exchanging goods ideas and cultures between different civilizations including the Han Chinese Mongols Persians and Europeans.
Antarctica is the largest continent as well as the largest desert in the world. This frigid wasteland dominates the South Pole with a massive surface area of 5.5 million square miles ( 14.2 million square kilometers). Antarctica also is the windiest continent and home to one of the driest places on Earth — the McMurdo Dry valleys. The McMurdo Dry valleys region is the only recorded area on Earth devoid of any microbial life. For such a large space covered in seemingly endless ice it may be strange to learn that the worlds largest desert only receives 0.8 inches (2 centimeters) of precipitation per year. Sadly this top spot on the worlds largest desert list may not be locked in for long. With climate change and the unprecedented levels of ice melt at Earths poles polar deserts like this one may shrink in coming years leading to rising sea levels and an irreparable disruption of these essential and fragile ecosystems.
One of Earths most interesting natural features the Caspian Sea is the largest inland body of water on the planet defying conventional classifications to be both a sea and a lake. Situated between Europe and Asia this colossal sea has plenty of other unique qualities too such as its unusual salinity distinct geography and biodiversity and its economic and political significance to the five nations that surround it.
Nestled within the heart of the Caspian region the Caspian Sea lies at the crossroads of continents bordered by five countries: Kazakhstan to the northeast Turkmenistan to the east Iran to the south Azerbaijan to the west and Russia to the northwest. Stretching over 745 miles (1200 km) from north to south and spanning a surface area of approximately 143200 square miles (371000 square km) the Caspian Sea holds the title of the worlds largest inland body of water. For reference this means its surface area is roughly equal to the country of Japan. 
The geopolitical borders of the Caspian Sea have been a source of contention for decades among the Caspian littoral states (the countries along the seas shores): Kazakhstan Turkmenistan Iran Azerbaijan and Russia. Disputes over territorial waters and the delineation of exclusive economic zones are ongoing. These five countries each with its own interests and agendas must regularly navigate complex negotiations over resource extraction maritime boundaries and environmental conservation as in relation to the worlds largest inland body of water. For example Iranian patrol boats cruise the south Caspian asserting Irans sovereignty over its share of the sea while Russia maintains a strong presence in the northern Caspian. Naval forces from all five countries maintain a presence on and around the sea.
